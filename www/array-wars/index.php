<h1>A Long Time Ago...</h1>
<p>In November 2005, for <a href="https://www.nanowrimo.org">National Novel Writing Month</a>, I came up with the concept of <strong>Array Wars</strong>&mdash;a "<em>Star Wars</em>/<em>Matrix</em> parody crossover" novel. Over the next few years (finally completing the story in early 2013) I wrote three novels, a complete trilogy which left a few threads hanging to allow me to pick it back up if I wished.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun writing it, and everybody who read it seemed to like it. I was happy with what I'd managed to produce&mdash;a pop-culture-heavy mish-mash of characters and situations plucked from a bunch of different science fiction universes, with a few original characters thrown in for good measure&mdash;and while it was certainly not publishable, I <em>did</em> get it printed up in paperback for distribution to friends and family. I had ebooks available here, for download. Those novels&mdash;a few copies, at least&mdash;exist, out in the world.</p>
<p>Except. Except they are problematic. Some of the cheap humour (mostly in, but not limited to, the character names) is <strong>sexist, racist, and homophobic</strong>.</p>
<p>As I progressed through the series, I was also becoming active on <em>Tumblr</em> and <em>Twitter</em>. My social conscience (and consciousness) was given a healthy shove in the right direction, and I started thinking about how I could make my later work more inclusive, but in many ways I found I'd painted myself into a corner. The third book in the series shows signs of these awakenings, but it was still locked into its less-than-stellar origins. And oh, those cringeworthy character names!</p>
<p>I like to think I've grown as a person in the 14 years since I began working on <em>Array Wars</em>, and I can no longer, in good conscience, make those novels available here.</p>
<p>However, despite its problematic beginnings, I still think the <em>Array Wars</em> concept has promise. There were some good ideas in there that deserve another chance. At its core, the original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy on which my work was most closely based is a story of redemption&mdash;and so it seems only fitting that I should redeem <em>Array Wars</em> (and myself) by rebooting the concept.</p>
<p><em>Array Wars</em> will be back. It will still be unpublishable (based, as it is, on a bunch of characters now owned by Disney, not to mention Paramount and others) but at least I'll no longer feel embarrassed to mention it in polite company...</p>
<h2>The Concept</h2>
<p>Imagine if people were trapped inside a virtual reality, a dream inside a machine, knowing only what they see. Now, imagine if this virtual reality was one of many, based upon popular entertainments. Imagine it had been running for a very long time, and was beginning to show signs of age: data is becoming corrupted, and the boundaries between realities are breaking down.</p>
<p>This was the original idea behind <em>Array Wars</em>: a means of combining <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>The Matrix</em> into a single crossover narrative. I wanted to tackle a couple of the sillier flaws from the original movies (which I love; don't get me wrong) but that was about as far as it went.</p>
<p>For the rewrite, I shall stick to this same basic premise&mdash;but perhaps take the idea of crumbling boundaries a little further, and reign in the whole "corruption of names" angle somewhat.</p>
<p>And, of course, try to do better on every level.</p>
